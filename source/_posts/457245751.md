用Python基于Google Bard做一个交互式的聊天机器人
--------------------------------

用Python基于Google Bard做一个交互式的聊天机器人
================================

之前已经通过浏览器试过了 `Google Bard` ，更多细节请看： [Try out Google Bard, Will Google Bard beat the ChatGPT?](https://www.pkslow.com/docs/en/try-out-google-bard).

现在我们想实现自动化，所以我用`Python`做一个交互式的聊天机器人。

获取Session ID
------------

通过浏览器先拿到SessionID，它是一个`cookie`，名为 `__Secure-1PSID`，然后复制一下对应的值：

![](https://img2023.cnblogs.com/other/946674/202303/946674-20230324002217727-1047957316.png)

Python代码
--------

先做一些初始化，主要是一些请求头和请求参数：

    def __init__(self, session_id):
      headers = {
        "Host": "bard.google.com",
        "X-Same-Domain": "1",
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.114 Safari/537.36",
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8",
        "Origin": "https://bard.google.com",
        "Referer": "https://bard.google.com/",
      }
      self._reqid = int("".join(random.choices(string.digits, k=4)))
      self.conversation_id = ""
      self.response_id = ""
      self.choice_id = ""
      self.session = requests.Session()
      self.session.headers = headers
      self.session.cookies.set("__Secure-1PSID", session_id)
      self.SNlM0e = self.__get_snlm0e()
    

发送请求的时候，把之前准备的参数和数据发一个POST请求到 `bard.google.com`：

    resp = self.session.post(
      "https://bard.google.com/_/BardChatUi/data/assistant.lamda.BardFrontendService/StreamGenerate",
      params=params,
      data=data,
      timeout=120,
    )
    

返回了之后，需要解析消息体，获取我们所需要的信息：

    chat_data = json.loads(resp.content.splitlines()[3])[0][2]
    if not chat_data:
      return {"content": f"Google Bard encountered an error: {resp.content}."}
    json_chat_data = json.loads(chat_data)
    results = {
      "content": json_chat_data[0][0],
      "conversation_id": json_chat_data[1][0],
      "response_id": json_chat_data[1][1],
      "factualityQueries": json_chat_data[3],
      "textQuery": json_chat_data[2][0] if json_chat_data[2] is not None else "",
      "choices": [{"id": i[0], "content": i[1]} for i in json_chat_data[4]],
    }
    

运行与尝试

    python Bard.py --session 'UgiXYPjpaIYuE9K_3BSxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' 
    

它一个交互式的终端，我随便问了几个问题：

    ChatGPT - A command-line interface to Google's Bard (https://bard.google.com/)
            
    You:
    What is terrible-two?
    
    Google Bard:
    Terrible-two is a term used to describe the behavior of a child around the age of 2. It is a normal developmental phase that all children go through. During this time, children  
    are learning to assert their independence and explore the world around them. This can lead to tantrums, defiance, and other challenging behavior.                                 
    
    There are a few things that parents can do to help manage the terrible twos:                                                                                                      
    
     • Be patient and understanding. Remember that this is a normal phase and that your child is not trying to be difficult.                                                          
     • Set clear boundaries and expectations. Children need to know what is expected of them.                                                                                         
     • Be consistent with your discipline. If you are not consistent, your child will not learn what is right and wrong.                                                              
     • Offer positive reinforcement. Praise your child for good behavior and help them feel good about themselves.                                                                    
     • Talk to your child's doctor if you are concerned about their behavior. Your doctor can offer advice and support.                                                               
    
    The terrible twos can be a challenging time for parents, but it is important to remember that this is a normal phase and that your child will eventually grow out of it.          
    
    You:
    how far is the moon?
    
    Google Bard:
    The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 km) away from Earth. This distance varies slightly because the Moon's orbit is not a perfect circle. The Moon is closest to Earth
    at perigee, which is when it is about 225,623 miles (363,104 km) away. It is farthest from Earth at apogee, which is when it is about 252,088 miles (405,696 km) away.            
    
    You:
    how far is the sun?
    
    Google Bard:
    The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from Earth. That's about 1 Astronomical Unit (AU).                                                                
    
    The Sun is the center of our solar system. All of the planets and other objects in our solar system orbit around the Sun. The Sun is a very large star. It is about 109 times the 
    diameter of Earth and about 330,000 times more massive than Earth. The Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium. It is so hot that the hydrogen and helium are constantly     
    fusing together to create heavier elements. This process is called nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion releases a lot of energy, which is what powers the Sun.                         
    
    You:
    how to cure a flu?
    
    Google Bard:
    There is no cure for the flu, but there are treatments that can help relieve symptoms and prevent complications. The most effective way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine
    every year.                                                                                                                                                                       
    
    If you get the flu, there are a few things you can do to feel better:                                                                                                             
    
     • Rest. Get plenty of sleep and avoid strenuous activity.                                                                                                                        
     • Drink plenty of fluids. Water, juice, and soup are all good choices.                                                                                                           
     • Take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.                                                                                                          
     • Use a humidifier. The moisture can help soothe your throat and make it easier to breathe.                                                                                      
     • See a doctor if you have severe symptoms or are at high risk of complications.                                                                                                 
    
    Here are some tips to help you prevent the flu:                                                                                                                                   
    
     • Get a flu vaccine every year. The flu vaccine is the best way to prevent the flu.                                                                                              
     • Wash your hands often with soap and water. This helps to prevent the spread of germs.                                                                                          
     • Avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you must be around someone who is sick, wear a mask.                                                                          
     • Clean and disinfect surfaces that may be contaminated with germs.                                                                                                              
     • Stay home from work or school if you are sick. This will help to prevent the spread of the flu.                                                                                
     • Eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly. A healthy immune system is better able to fight off infection.                                                                      
    
    You:
