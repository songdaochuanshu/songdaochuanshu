> 内容描述

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 * `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
 * `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
 * `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from `1` to `3999`.

##### Example 1:
```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```

##### Example 2:
```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```

##### Example 3:
```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```

##### Example 4:
```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

##### Example 5:
```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```


## 解题方案

******- 时间复杂度: O(N)******- 空间复杂度: O(1)******


代码：

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} roman
 * @return {number}
 */
let romanToInt = function (roman) {
    let result = 0;
    let obj = {
        'I':1,
        'IV':4,
        'V':5,
        'IX':9,
        'X':10,
        'XL':40,
        'L':50,
        'XC':90,
        'C':100,
        'CD':400,
        'D':500,
        'CM':900,
        'M':1000
    };
    for(let len = roman.length,i = len -1;i>=0; i--){
       if(i - 1 >= 0 && `${roman.charAt(i - 1)}${roman.charAt(i)}` in obj){
           result = result + obj[`${roman.charAt(i - 1)}${roman.charAt(i)}`];
           i--;
       }else{
           result = result + obj[roman.charAt(i)];
       }
    }
    return result;
};
```
