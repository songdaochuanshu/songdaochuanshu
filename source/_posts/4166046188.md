MatrixOne从入门到实践08——SSB性能测试
==========================

MatrixOne从入门到实践——SSB性能测试
========================

SSB 星型模式基准测试是 OLAP 数据库性能测试的常用场景，通过本篇教程，您可以了解到如何在 MatrixOne 中实现 SSB 测试。

测试环境
----

*   机器配置
    
    机器数量
    
    部署方式
    
    CPU
    
    内存
    
    磁盘
    
    1
    
    单节点
    
    6
    
    36G
    
    100G
    
*   MO版本
    
    0.5.1版本
    

编译**dbgen**
-----------

*   获取源码
    
        git clone https://github.com/vadimtk/ssb-dbgen.git
        
    
    如果因为网络问题导致clone失败，建议使用gitee将上述链接项目导入到自己的仓库，然后使用gitee的链接clone
    
*   编译
    
        cd ssb-dbgen 
        make
        
    

生成数据
----

当使用 `-s 1` 时 `dbgen` 命令会生产近600万行数据(670MB)，当使用`-s 10`时会生产近6000万行数据，会耗费大量时间。

    ./dbgen -s 1 -T c
    ./dbgen -s 1 -T l
    ./dbgen -s 1 -T p
    ./dbgen -s 1 -T s
    ./dbgen -s 1 -T d
    

生成完成后，会有以下数据文件，这里只生成了多表的数据。

    [root@motest ssb]# ll -h |grep tbl
    -r-sr-S--T. 1 root root 3.2M Oct  1 09:30 customer.tbl
    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 270K Oct  1 09:31 date.tbl
    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 641M Oct  1 09:31 lineorder.tbl
    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root  20M Oct  1 09:31 part.tbl
    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 187K Oct  1 09:31 supplier.tbl
    

SSB的大宽表数据集请下载：

    wget https://community-shared-data-1308875761.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/lineorder_flat.tar.bz2
    

解压数据集：

*   导入数据
    
    请根据自己生成的数据的路径，自行调整导入语句中的路径参数
    
    如我生成数据的路径为：/home/ssb/ssb/\*\*\*.tbl
    
    则对应单表导入语句为：
    
        load data infile '/home/ssb/ssb/supplier.tbl' into table supplier FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
        
        load data infile '/home/ssb/ssb/customer.tbl' into table customer FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
        
        load data infile '/home/ssb/ssb/date.tbl' into table dates FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
        
        load data infile '/home/ssb/ssb/part.tbl' into table part FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
        
        load data infile '/home/ssb/ssb/lineorder.tbl' into table lineorder FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
        
    
    大宽表导入语句为：
    
        load data infile '/home/ssb/ssb/lineorder_flat.tbl' into table lineorder_flat FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
