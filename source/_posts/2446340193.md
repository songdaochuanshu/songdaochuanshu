开发了一个Java库的Google Bard API，可以自动化与AI对话了
--------------------------------------

开发了一个Java库的Google Bard API，可以自动化与AI对话了
======================================

`Google Bard`是Google提供的还在实验阶段的人工智能对话服务。这明显是对标`ChatGPT`来的，它可以提供更实时的答案，会基于Google强大的网页数据。

为了更方便的使用并实现自动化，我写了一个Java类库，GitHub仓库地址为：[https://github.com/LarryDpk/Google-Bard](https://github.com/LarryDpk/Google-Bard)

欢迎大家STAR...

如何使用
----

使用是非常简单的，只要网络通就可以了。

### 引入依赖

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.pkslow</groupId>
            <artifactId>google-bard</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.1</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    

### 拿到验证Token

目前没有用户名密码的方式，直接有Token就行。但这个要从网页上拿。它其实就是一个Cookie，名为`__Secure-1PSID`：

> 据说Google未来会开放API接口，拭目以待吧。

### Java代码

两行代码即可：

    AIClient client = new GoogleBardClient(token);
    List<String> answers = client.ask("How to be a good father?");
    

返回的是一个列表：  
如果`Google Bard`能够回答问题，一般会给出三个答案。第一个是推荐的答案。

    for (int i = 0; i < answers.size(); i++) {
        if (i == 0) {
            System.out.println("### Recommended Answer");
            System.out.println(answers.get(i));
        } else {
            System.out.println("### Answer " + i);
            System.out.println(answers.get(i));
        }
    }
    

`Google Bard`目前还是实验阶段，只在美国英国可用，所以你懂的：

    NetworkUtils.setUpProxy("localhost", "7890");
    

这个要在程序最开始设置。
