20220406Java字符串操作类中scompareTo()
===============================

记个笔记

字符串操作类中**s1.compareTo(s)**规则**：**

Compares two strings lexicographically. The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings. The character sequence represented by this `String` object is compared lexicographically to the character sequence represented by the argument string. The result is a negative integer if this `String` object lexicographically precedes the argument string. The result is a positive integer if this `String` object lexicographically follows the argument string. The result is zero if the strings are equal; `compareTo` returns `0` exactly when the `equals(Object)` method would return `true`.

This is the definition of lexicographic ordering. If two strings are different, then either they have different characters at some index that is a valid index for both strings, or their lengths are different, or both. If they have different characters at one or more index positions, let _k_ be the smallest such index; then the string whose character at position _k_ has the smaller value, as determined by using the `<` operator, lexicographically precedes the other string. In this case, `compareTo` returns the difference of the two character values at position `k` in the two string -- that is, the value:

>  this.charAt(k)-anotherString.charAt(k)
>  

**If there is no index position at which they differ, then the shorter string lexicographically precedes the longer string. In this case, `compareTo` returns the difference of the lengths of the strings -- that is, the value:**

>  this.length()-anotherString.length() 

**1.当字符串s1和s都表示数字时，有三种结果-1（代表s1<s） ，  0（代表s与s1相等）  ，1（代表s1>s）。**

**2.当字符串s1和s不表示数字时，有三种结果负整数 （代表s1和s中的第一个不相同的字符的Unicode值相减为负数），0（代表s与s1相等） ，**

**正整数（代表s1和s中的第一个不相同的字符的Unicode值相减为正数）；若s1包含s（即s中的字符，s1都有），也有上述三种结果**

**但意义不同（除0表示相等）其中正整数表示s1包含s且长度大于s；反之为负整数。**

**3.Unicode中 a表示61   A表示41其它字母类推。**

**最后总结英语是有必要学的！**
