I'm ÊùæÂ≤õÂ∑ùÊ†ë. I'm a freelance web developer based in China. I established an open source organization on GitHub. Click [here](https://github.com/Magic-Academy/.github/issues/new?assignees=&labels=invite%20me%20to%20the%20organisation&template=invitation.yml&title=Please%20invite%20me%20to%20the%20GitHub%20Community%20Organization) to apply for membership; we'd be super glad to have you join us.

I've been a part of the GitHub community for **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years. During this time, I've made **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, and reviewed **{{ CODE_REVIEWS }}** pull requests. My contributions have earned **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects, and I've contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.

The most used languages across my projects are:

{{ LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_START:max=9 }}
[{{LANGUAGE_NAME}}](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=flat-square&label={{LANGUAGE_NAME:uri}}&color=555&labelColor={{LANGUAGE_COLOR:uri}}&message={{LANGUAGE_PERCENT:uri}}%25)
{{ LANGUAGE_TEMPLATE_END }}

By the way, my personal page is built using a project by Rock Chen, which you can find at [chansee97/nuxt-blog](https://github.com/chansee97/nuxt-blog).

Happy coding!
